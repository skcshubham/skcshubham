### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**skcshubham/skcshubham** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile. -->

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on C++14 and JavaScript. 
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Dynamic and Parallel Programming. 
- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on Competitive Coding.
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about life and Algorithms.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I have left Social Media for 6+ months now.
